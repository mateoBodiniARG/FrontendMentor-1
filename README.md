# Frontend Mentor
I use mentor frontend to practice my html and css skills. This website is used to create real projects with their documentation.
The good thing about Frontend Mentor is that it is divided into difficulties from newbie to guru. For those who are just starting out or want to practice the basics or for those who want to improve/create real projects
